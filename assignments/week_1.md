## Due before class on Friday, 9/5

### **Getting Situated** 
* **Join our class Discord server** (check your City Tech email for the invite link. If you did not receive it, email me at OFER.SHOUVAL11@citytech.cuny.edu)       
* **Download & Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)**
* **Install [p5.js extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode).**
* **[Review our syllabus](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Shouval_MTEC_1201_D_30_Shouval_FA25/edit/main/syllabus/Shouval-MTech1201-FA25.md)** and familiarize yourself with the plan and protocols. If you have questions, send me a DM (direct message) on Discord.  
* **Review your schedule** and allocate blocks of time for our class and outside homework. For this class, most assignments should take 3-5 hours. If more ambitious with the work, you may need more time than this, especially around midterm and finals when developing larger projects.  


### **Explore**   
* **[Look around the "discover" section of OpenProcessing.org](https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending)**. Read the instructions, skim the code (even if you don't understand any of it yet).
* **Select at least two sketches** that you find interesting.   
* **On our class Discord server** under the #inspiration channel, post the weblink for each sketch along with 1-3 sentences for what interests you about each sketch.

### **Optional/Recommended**  
I highly recommend reading ["What is Code?" by Paul Ford](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code). This interactive article came out in 2015 and is considered a masterpiece by many software developers. It is long. It can take a few hours to read, if really soaking it in, versus skimming through it quickly. At least skim it, slowing down when finding new concepts. But it's worth really taking your time with it, investing a few hours. If you have already read it, I still recommend revisiting it! The code for this article is open source and still actively maintained, though you may come across a bug here and there. (If you find a bug, you can [submit it here](https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/whatiscode)). 

## What we Looked At  
[How to Draw with Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8DMEHxOLQE), from the now defunct [Creator's Project](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/the-creators-project) mini-doc series, featuring [Casey Reas](https://reas.com/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/).
