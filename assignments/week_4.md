### Week 4 HW Assignment:
Due next Wednesday, October 8

1. Write 3-5 p5js sketches that iterate on the topics we've discussed in class today. The main topics we discussed were:
   - [Conditional statements](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/if/) (if, else)
   - [Transforms](https://p5js.org/reference/#Transform) (translate, scale, rotate)
     
  Make sure to include at least one of these concepts in each of your iterations. Perhaps you have a goal in mind, some kind of idea you'd like to 
  pursue to as far as possible. If so, you can think of each of these 'iterations' as a way of showing your work as you move towards your final goal. 
  Or of course you can just try a bunch of different ideas out.
  
2. Once you're done with your HW assignment, put them in a folder inside your repository. Take some time to organize your repo, making sure all your HW assignments so far are there and clearly marked.

If you are confused about anything, Dan Shiffman's got an excellent youtube channel which goes basically all things p5js. We have 3 weeks till we meet again so i'd encourage you to check out some of his videos, and perhaps bring some new concepts into your HW assignment. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) is particularly useful for all the basics.
