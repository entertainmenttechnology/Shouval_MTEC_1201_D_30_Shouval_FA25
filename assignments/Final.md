# MTECH 1201 Final Project

For your final, you will be creating an **interactive web experience** and publishing it on the internet using **GitHub Pages**.

This interactive web experience could be many things.  
It could be something practical — for instance, a creative coding portfolio site.  
Or it could be something completely experimental and off the wall.  
You could create a game of some kind, tell a story, or even build an instrument.
