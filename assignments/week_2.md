## Due before class on Wednesday, 9/10

### Familiarize Yourself with the following resources on the p5.js website:
* p5.js [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
* p5.js [examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)
* p5.js [tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/)

The basics:

* [setup()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/setup/)
* [createCanvas()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/createCanvas/)
* [The coordinate system and shapes](https://archive.p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html)

Color, fill, stroke:
(There are multiple ways of inputting color values-- I recommend using r, g, b).

* [background()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/background/)
* [fill()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/fill/) and [noFill()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noFill/)
* [stroke(), noStroke(), and strokeWeight()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/stroke/)

Check out this [color tutorial](https://archive.p5js.org/learn/color.html)

Shape:
* In the "Shape" category, review all functions under "2D primitives" in the p5.js reference.
* Review [rectMode()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rectMode/).
* Optional / if feeling ambitious: check out functions under "Curves" and "Vertex" in the reference, along with this curves tutorial.
Find the in-class demos on our Open Processing class page.

### Short Study #1: Beginning to Draw with Code
Brainstorm a concept/theme that you would like to explore for a series of drawings made with code, to develop through weekly "short studies" with increasing complexity. For this first sketch of the series, create a static drawing using p5.js with 2D primitive shapes.

Projects must include:

* A canvas width of at least 500 pixels, max 1920 pixels.
* A canvas height of at least 500 pixels, max 1080 pixels.
* At least 3 different types of primitives.
* Variation in stroke weight and fill color.

Comments at the top of your sketch (where you are coding, not the canvas output), including:
* Your first name and last initial
* The title for your drawing
* A brief explanation of the concept or theme you are choosing to explore for the semester and how this first sketch ties into it.

Save the completed sketch as "SS1_[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "SS1_OferS"). Zip the folder and submit it to the class brightspace in the assignment called "Short Study 1".
