## Course Info 
MTEC 1201 Section D30     
Computer Programming for Interactive Media I   
Professor: Ofer Shouval    
When: Wednesdays, 10:00am - 2:40    
Modality: Fully in person    
Location: Voorhees V103B      

### COURSE DESCRIPTION  
This course introduces students to foundational programming concepts and techniques, with a focus on coding for creative applications. Students design, develop, and code interactive software experiences integrating computer graphics, image assets, text and fonts, and additional digital media. Programming for Interactive Media is the first in a sequence of coding courses for the Emerging Media Technology program, preparing students for advanced coursework in the program.

### LEARNING OUTCOMES       
For the successful completion of this course, a student should be able to:    
* Develop literacy for reading and writing in a coding language.  
* Recognize and articulate computational strategies used in contemporary interactive media projects.  
* Demonstrate learning and problem-solving methodologies, including use of coding reference, documentation materials, and flow charting.    
* Implement foundational coding concepts and techniques to realize interactive software experiences, including use of: variables, logical comparison, and arithmetic operators; conditionals, functions; loops; arrays; and an introduction to Object Oriented Programming.  
* Design, develop, debug, and iterate an interactive software experience from ideation through final project presentation.  
   
  
###  COURSE STRUCTURE  
The course combines lectures and presentations, critiques, discussions, and studio/lab time. Typically, students work on technical exercises each week, along with creative short study projects integrating these newly learned techniques. There will be two larger interactive software projects during the semester- a midterm and final project- largely independently driven, with iterative project development.            
    
Course materials and assignments will generally be posted to GitHub on Wednesdays of each week, due the following Wednesday before class begins. We will create small peer groups for extra tech support during and outside of class hours.    

  
## PROJECTS AND ASSIGNMENTS      
* Weekly creative short study assignments, demonstrating programming proficiency and creative concept development. Students implement required technical parameters for each week, while engaging with a chosen creative theme.   
* Midterm project – a largely self-directed work exploring the topics covered in the first half of the semester, while expanding upon one or more short study assignments. These are multi-week, scaffolded projects with work-in-progress deadlines, peer playtesting, and final critiques.   
* Final project – a largely self-directed work, supported by independent research and iterative project development. Students present proposals for the instructor to green-light, which includes a calendar of tasks and deliverables. These are multi-week, scaffolded projects with work-in-progress deadlines, peer playtesting, and final critiques.   
  
  
## REQUIRED MATERIALS               
* A sketchbook, or paper to sketch with (does not need to be exclusive to this class)    
* A Mac or PC computer with internet access [see "Laptop Requirements" under Resources for more info]
* Free software and accounts: Discord, Github, Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome Browser
