## Instructions for Newbies    
  
_If you are completely new to GitHub, I recommend using GitHub Desktop, a visual interface that does not require command line and terminal. Please bear with these step by step instructions-- they are long!_  
  
1.  **Go to github.com and sign in**, or create a free account (if you do not have one already): https://github.com/join

2. **Create a new repository** on your GitHub account online. Title the repository MTEC1201_FirstName (for example: MTEC1201_Ian). Select "Public" for repository type. **Check the box to initialize the repository with a README**.  

3. **Send me your GitHub user name on Discord.**  

4.  **Download GitHub for Desktop** at: https://desktop.github.com . Install and open the application. Sign in with your Github.com login.

5.  **Clone Your Respository**:  
    * Return to the "code" tab of your online repository.   
    * Select the green “Code” button, and then select “open in desktop”.    
    * You should see a prompt asking where you'd like to locally clone your repository. Keep the default path, or modify it to a different location, and select the "clone" button. You may receive an error that "Git can only clone to empty folders." In this case, modify the file path and create a new empty folder for the repo to clone to. Select the "clone" button.
    * You should now have your repo online at GitHub.com and cloned locally on your computer. Double check both locations. 

6.  **Go through all past assignments and re-label as needed**:  
     * All assignments should each be in their own p5.js project folder labeled with the short study # and title (SS#_Title), making sure that required project files are contained within. For example, a project should be contained within folder "SS1_SunnyDay". Inside that folder would be a "sketch.js" file, a "libraries" folder, and all other required p5.js project files.

7.  **Push your files to GitHub**:  
    * Place your SS1 folder into your **_local_** GitHub repository (stored on your computer).   
    * Go back to the GitHub Desktop app. You should see a notice of uncommitted changes, because your local repo just changed.   
    * Select the changes that you want to commit, and write a summary of the commit within the summary field (for example: “add SS1”).  
    * Select “commit to master”. You should now see no more uncommitted changes.   
    * **One more very critical step!** Currently, your commits are saved to your local repo, and we want to mirror these changes on the online repo. To do this, we "push" the commits. In the desktop app menu, go to Repository--> Push.   
    * Check your online repo. You should see your SS1 folder there now.    
    * Go through the same process for any remaining assignments.

8.  **As you continue to work on assignments**:  
    * Any time you make a change to files within your local repo, you should see the uncommitted changes appear on the GitHub Desktop app.   
    * Commit and push your changes often (at the very least, at the end of each working session), detailing what each change is (for example: “add timer” or “fix count variable”). 
     * If you commit and push your changes often, this will take advantage of Git's version control. This will save you from losing work or "breaking your code". You can go back at any time and check the history of your files if you've been making commits along the way.    
    * If you want to create separate space for work in progress on your repo, feel free to add additional working folders for yourself. I will only be grading folders labeled specifically for our assignments (SS1, SS2, SS3, etc.) 
  
9. **If your local repository is "behind" your online repository in commits**:  
    * For example, if you are working on two separate computers, you may need to "pull" changes from the online repo to the local repo.
    * In the desktop app menu, go to Repository--> Pull. 

**Authenticating to GitHub**: You may receive an error during set up if you have not authenticated your GitHub account yet. Follow [instructions for authenticating to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github).
